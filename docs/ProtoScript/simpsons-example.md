# **Simpsons Example for Prototype Modeling**

ProtoScript’s Prototypes excel at modeling real-world entities and relationships within a dynamic, graph-based ontology, offering a flexible alternative to traditional ontologies like OWL or RDF. This section uses the fictional dataset from *The Simpsons* to demonstrate how ProtoScript creates an ontology-like structure to represent characters, locations, and their interconnections. By modeling entities such as Homer, Marge, and the Simpsons’ house as Prototypes, we illustrate how ProtoScript’s unified graph framework captures complex relationships (e.g., family ties, locations) with ease, supports runtime adaptability, and enables reasoning through structural patterns. This example highlights ProtoScript’s ability to go beyond traditional ontologies, which often rely on static schemas and formal axioms, by providing a developer-friendly, dynamic approach to knowledge representation.

## **Why This Example Matters**

The *Simpsons* dataset is relatable and rich with relationships, making it an ideal case study for demonstrating ProtoScript’s ontology capabilities:

* **Real-World Modeling**: Characters (e.g., Homer, Marge) and locations (e.g., Springfield) form a network of relationships, mirroring real-world ontologies like geographic or social systems.  
* **Dynamic Ontology**: ProtoScript’s Prototypes allow runtime modifications (e.g., adding new relationships), unlike OWL’s rigid class hierarchies.  
* **Cross-Domain Potential**: The model can integrate with other domains (e.g., linking characters to a database or natural language queries), showcasing ProtoScript’s versatility.  
* **Reasoning and Relationships**: The graph enables discovery of relationships (e.g., family structures) and transformations (e.g., generating queries about characters).

ProtoScript’s Prototypes support runtime evolution, unify different entity types under a single construct, and rely on structural generalization for reasoning, offering a practical contrast to OWL’s static schemas and formal axioms.

### **Analogy to Familiar Concepts**

For **C\# developers**:

* Prototypes are like classes that can represent people, places, or relationships in a graph, similar to an ORM mapping objects to a database but with dynamic, graph-based flexibility.  
* Think of this as building a social network model where objects (characters) link to others (locations, family) in a graph database.

For **JavaScript developers**:

* Prototypes resemble JavaScript objects in a graph, where each object (e.g., Homer) can inherit from multiple prototypes and link to others, like a JSON-based knowledge graph.

For **database developers**:

* The ontology is like a graph database where nodes (Prototypes) represent entities and edges (properties) define relationships, but with programmable behaviors via functions.

## **Modeling The Simpsons Ontology**

This example models key characters (Homer, Marge, Bart) and locations (Simpsons’ house, Springfield) from *The Simpsons*, demonstrating how ProtoScript creates a graph-based ontology. We’ll define Prototypes, establish relationships, and show how the model supports querying and reasoning.

### **Prototype Definitions**

Below is ProtoScript code to model the *Simpsons* ontology using canonical syntax (lowercase `string` for literals and direct literal initializers).

prototype Entity {  
    string Name \= "";  
}  
prototype Location : Entity {  
    string Address \= "";  
}  
prototype Person : Entity {  
    string Gender \= "";  
    Location Location \= new Location();  
    Collection ParentOf \= new Collection();  
    Person Spouse \= new Person();  
    int Age \= 0;  
}  
prototype SimpsonsHouse : Location {  
    Name \= "Simpsons House";  
    Address \= "742 Evergreen Terrace";  
}  
prototype Springfield : Location {  
    Name \= "Springfield";  
    Address \= "Unknown";  
}  
prototype Homer : Person {  
    Name \= "Homer Simpson";  
    Gender \= "Male";  
    Location \= SimpsonsHouse;  
    ParentOf \= \[Bart, Lisa, Maggie\];  
    Spouse \= Marge;  
    Age \= 39;  
}  
prototype Marge : Person {  
    Name \= "Marge Simpson";  
    Gender \= "Female";  
    Location \= SimpsonsHouse;  
    ParentOf \= \[Bart, Lisa, Maggie\];  
    Spouse \= Homer;  
    Age \= 36;  
}  
prototype Bart : Person {  
    Name \= "Bart Simpson";  
    Gender \= "Male";  
    Location \= SimpsonsHouse;  
    Age \= 10;  
}  
prototype Lisa : Person {  
    Name \= "Lisa Simpson";  
    Gender \= "Female";  
    Location \= SimpsonsHouse;  
    Age \= 8;  
}  
prototype Maggie : Person {  
    Name \= "Maggie Simpson";  
    Gender \= "Female";  
    Location \= SimpsonsHouse;  
    Age \= 1;  
}

**What’s Happening?**

* `Entity` is a base Prototype with a `Name` property, acting as a root for all entities.  
* `Location` inherits from `Entity`, adding an `Address` property.  
* `Person` inherits from `Entity`, defining properties for `Gender`, `Location`, `ParentOf`, `Spouse`, and `Age`, using lowercase types (`string`, `int`) with direct literals.  
* Specific instances (`Homer`, `Marge`, `Bart`, `SimpsonsHouse`) set literal values (e.g., `"Male"`, `39`), which the runtime translates to NativeValuePrototypes.  
* Relationships are established via properties (e.g., `Homer.Spouse = Marge`, `Homer.ParentOf = [Bart, Lisa, Maggie]`).  
* **Graph View**: Nodes for `Homer`, `Marge`, and `SimpsonsHouse` are linked via edges (`Spouse`, `Location`, `ParentOf`), forming a network of relationships.

**Syntax Notes**:

* Use lowercase `string`, `bool`, `int` for primitive types with direct literals (e.g., `"Homer Simpson"`, `39`).
* Avoid constructor-style wrappers for primitives unless explicitly needed, aligning with examples like `string Name = "Buffalo"`.
* `Collection` represents lists (e.g., `ParentOf`), matching document conventions.

### **Ontology Structure**

The *Simpsons* model forms a graph-based ontology:

* **Classes**: `Entity`, `Location`, `Person` act as conceptual classes, like OWL classes, but are dynamic Prototypes.  
* **Individuals**: `Homer`, `Marge`, `SimpsonsHouse` are instances, akin to RDF individuals, linked via properties.  
* **Properties**: `Spouse`, `ParentOf`, `Location` are edges, similar to OWL object properties, but support runtime additions and cycles (e.g., `Homer.Spouse ↔ Marge.Spouse`).  
* **Reasoning**: The graph enables structural queries (e.g., finding all parents) without formal axioms.

ProtoScript models can add properties at runtime (e.g., introducing an `Occupation` property to `Person`), use the same `prototype` construct for characters and locations, and integrate with external data sources such as databases.

### **Querying the Ontology**

ProtoScript’s graph model supports querying relationships using functions and operators:

prototype Person {  
    string Gender \= "";  
    Location Location \= new Location();  
    Collection ParentOf \= new Collection();  
    Person Spouse \= new Person();  
    int Age \= 0;  
    function IsParent() : bool {  
        return ParentOf.Count \> 0;  
    }  
    function LivesInSpringfield() : bool {  
        return Location \-\> Location { this.Name \== "Springfield" };  
    }  
}

**What’s Happening?**

* `IsParent` checks if a `Person` has children by counting `ParentOf` entries.  
* `LivesInSpringfield` uses the `->` operator to verify if the `Location`’s `Name` is `"Springfield"`.  
* **Usage**: `Homer.IsParent()` returns `true`, `Homer.LivesInSpringfield()` returns `true` (if `SimpsonsHouse` links to `Springfield`).  
* **Graph View**: `IsParent` traverses `ParentOf` edges, `LivesInSpringfield` follows `Location` to check `Name`.  
* Queries use structural traversal rather than OWL-style axiomatic reasoning.

### **Discovering Relationships**

The graph enables discovery of relationships:

* **Family Structure**: `Homer.ParentOf` and `Marge.ParentOf` both link to `Bart`, `Lisa`, `Maggie`, revealing shared parenthood.  
* **Location-Based Grouping**: Querying `Person` nodes with `Location = SimpsonsHouse` identifies residents (Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie).  
* **Spousal Symmetry**: `Homer.Spouse = Marge` and `Marge.Spouse = Homer` form a bidirectional relationship, modeled naturally as a cycle.

**Example Function**:

prototype Person {  
    Collection ParentOf \= new Collection();  
    function GetChildrenNames() : Collection {  
        Collection names \= new Collection();  
        foreach (Person child in ParentOf) {  
            names.Add(child.Name);  
        }  
        return names;  
    }  
}

**What’s Happening?**

* `GetChildrenNames` collects `Name` properties from `ParentOf` nodes.  
* `Homer.GetChildrenNames()` returns a collection with `"Bart Simpson"`, `"Lisa Simpson"`, `"Maggie Simpson"`.  
* The dynamic query uses ProtoScript’s native graph traversal instead of predefined SPARQL queries.

### **Cross-Domain Transformations**

The *Simpsons* ontology can integrate with other domains:

* **Database Integration**: Link `Person` to a database table `Residents` with columns `Name`, `Gender`, `Age`, mapping `Homer.Name` to a record.

**Natural Language**: Transform a query like "Who lives in Springfield?" into a ProtoScript function:  
prototype Query {  
    string Question \= "";  
    function ToPersonList() : Collection {  
        Collection people \= new Collection();  
        if (Question \== "Who lives in Springfield?") {  
            foreach (Person p in AllPersons) {  
                if (p.LivesInSpringfield()) {  
                    people.Add(p);  
                }  
            }  
        }  
        return people;  
    }  
}

*   
  * **What’s Happening?**: The function maps a natural language question to a list of `Person` nodes, leveraging the ontology.  
  * The transformation unifies NLP and graph querying without relying on OWL-specific processing pipelines.

## **Internal Mechanics**

The *Simpsons* ontology operates within ProtoScript’s graph-based runtime:

* **Nodes**: Prototypes (`Homer`, `SimpsonsHouse`) are nodes with unique IDs.  
* **Edges**: Properties (`Spouse`, `ParentOf`, `Location`) create edges, including cycles (e.g., `Homer ↔ Marge`).  
* **Runtime**: Translates literals (e.g., `"Male"`, `39`) to NativeValuePrototypes, manages instantiation, and supports traversal.  
* **Querying**: Functions and operators (`->`, `typeof`) traverse the graph to evaluate relationships.

## **Why This Example Matters**

The *Simpsons* ontology showcases ProtoScript’s strengths:

* **Dynamic Modeling**: Prototypes capture complex relationships (family, location) with runtime flexibility, surpassing OWL’s static schemas.  
* **Unified Framework**: The same constructs model characters and locations, simplifying development compared to ontology-specific tools.  
* **Relationship Discovery**: The graph reveals family structures and location-based groupings naturally.  
* **Cross-Domain Potential**: The model supports integration with databases or NLP, enabling transformations like query generation.  
* **Developer-Friendly**: C\#-like syntax makes ontology creation accessible to developers, not just ontology experts.

## **Moving Forward**
